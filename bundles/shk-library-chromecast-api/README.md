To work with a modified upstream library we work on a copy of the upstream sources.
The intention is to move all changes upstream.
If changes break compatibility to older versions or we need very specific stuff, we could maintain it here.

* use the latest upstream sources
* integrate some custom patches (e.g. PR#38, PR#40)
* add the shk-only patches (https://github.com/maggu2810/chromecast-java-api-v2/tree/shk-only)
